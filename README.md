# Skin Cancer Detection using XAI

This project aims to create an automated tool to help detect skin cancer early and accurately using Machine Learning. It also uses Explainable AI to make the toolâ€™s decisions clear and understandable.


# Tech Stack

Backend : Python/Flask, PyTorch

Frontend : HTML/CSS

Models : Convolution Neural Network, ResNet50, Inception_V3, Xception

Explainable AI : LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM



## Features

-An automated tool for the early and accurate detection of skin cancer using Machine Learning. 

-Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze skin images and identify potential cancerous lesions.

-Incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, helping healthcare professionals trust the results and improve patient outcomes.




## Deployment

To deploy this project run it as any other Flask app after:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
